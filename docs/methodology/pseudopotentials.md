# Pseudopotentials Choice

Pseudopotentials are used to reduce computation time by replacing the
full electron system in the coulombic potential by a system only taking
explicitly into account the "valence" electrons (i.e., the electrons
participating into bonding) but in a pseudopotential. This approach not
only reduces the electron number but also the energy cutoff necessary
(this is critical in plane-wave based computations). All computations in
the materials project have been performed using a specific type of very
efficient pseudopotentials: the projector augmented wave (PAW)
pseudopotentials.[^1] We used the library of PAW pseudopotentials
provided by VASP but for a given element there is often several
possibility in the VASP library. This wiki presents how the choice
between the different pseudopotential option was operated detailing what
pseudopotential we chose and for what reason.

The strategy
------------

As a test set, we ran all elements and binary oxides present in the ICSD
with the several PAW pseudopotentials available. As it is difficult to
test for all properties (structural, electronic, etc...), we chose to be
inclusive and to select the pseudopotential with the largest number of
electrons EXCEPT if convergence issues were seen on our test set, or
previous experience excluded a specific pseudopotential. We also
excluded pseudopotentials with a too large energy cutoff.

We also compared to recommendations from the VASP manual present in
[1](http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/PAW_potentials.html).

Finally, as we had energies for elements and binary oxides, we compared
binary oxides formation energies with the several pseudopotentials
available. The oxygen molecule energy was obtained from Wang et al.
Please note that this data is pure GGA and some chemistries (e.g.,
transition metals) will give extremely bad formation energy results in
GGA. This is not an issue per se with the pseudopotential but with the
functional and we did not focus on this in this wiki.

Pseudopotential comments and choice
-----------------------------------

### 1st row elements

B, C, N, O, F

Usually they have three psp a soft \_s, a hard \_h and a standard...

The standard is recommended by VASP and will be used for all. The hard
have extremely high cut-offs (700 eV)

### alkali and alkali-earth

The table below indicates our choices. Basically, we chose all high e-
psp except for Na where we excluded Na\_sv due to its very high cutoff
(700 eV)

### main group

Si, P, Cl, S will be used in their standard form (not hard) as suggested
by VASP manual.

The Al\_h psp was found to be definitely wrong in terms of band
structure. There was "ghost" states found in the DOS.

Pb is interesting as the high e- psp shows significantly higher error in
formation energies. We kept the high e- psp (Pb\_d) but it might be
interesting to study this a little more. One hypothesis relies on a
recent result showing that lead oxide formation energies need the use of
spin-orbit coupling to be accurate.[^2] Our computations are without any
relativistic corrections for valence electrons. However, spin-orbit
coupling is taken into account during the psp construction. This would
explain why a psp with more core electrons (treated undirectly with SO
coupling) would give more accurate results than a psp with fewer
electrons.

Bi\_d shows convergence problem and the decision on Bi has been
postponed to further analysis.

Finally, Po and At while referred to in the VASP manual are not present
in the VASP PAW library.

### rare-earth, f-electrons

These are probably the most problematic to use as pseudopotentials. Here
is what the VASP manual says about them:

"Due to self-interaction errors, f-electrons are not handled well by
presently available density functionals. In particular, partially filled
states are often incorrectly described, leading to large errors for
Pr-Eu and Tb-Yb where the error increases in the middle (Gd is handled
reasonably well, since 7 electrons occupy the majority shell). These
errors are DFT and not VASP related. Particularly problematic is the
description of the transition from an itinerant (band-like) behavior
observed at the beginning of each period to localized states towards the
end of the period. For the elements, this transition occurs already in
La and Ce, whereas the transition sets in for Pu and Am for the
elements. A routine way to cope with the inabilities of present DFT
functionals to describe the localized electrons is to place the
electrons in the core. Such potentials are available and described
below. Furthermore, PAW potentials in which the states are treated as
valence states are available, but these potentials are not expected to
work reliable when the electrons are localized."

In summary, the pseudopotentials can either include or not include f
electrons; how accurate you would be by including
them or not will depend on the nature of the bonding
for each particular system (localized or not).

What we found is that convergence issues are often seen for high
electron psp (e.g., Pr, Nd, Sm). Also, some pseudopotentials (e.g.,
Er\_2, Eu\_2) freeze somehow too many electron and have issues with
oxidation states that make one of the frozen electron participate in
bonding (e.g., Eu2O3, Er2O3). Finally, there is a major problem with Tb.
Only Tb\_3 exists but Tb is known to also form Tb4+ compounds (e.g.,
TbO2). For those Tb4+ this psp is likely to be extremely wrong. There is
not much fix to this for now except waiting for someone to develop a PAW
Tb\_4 psp.
