## Formula
**Anonymous chemical formula:**
The chemical formula with the element names anonymized to the letters A, B, C, etc. The order of the anonymized elements is from least atomic fraction to greatest atomic fraction, thus the coefficients are non-decreasing. For example, both $\ce{TiO2}$ and $\ce{Na2O}$ have an anonymous formula of $\ce{A1B2}$.

## Structure
**Crystal system:**
The crystal system is commonly referred to as 'lattice' for periodic crystals and describes the shape of the repeating cell. Examples include cubic, tetragonal, and monoclinic. Calculations that simulate non-periodic systems, for example molecules, will be assigned as 'noncrystalline'.

**Number of sites in unit cell:**
The number of atoms in the unit cell of the calculation. For supercell calculations, this quantity refers to the number of atoms in the full supercell.

**Cell volume:**
The volume, in cubic Angstroms, of the unit cell of the calculation. For supercell calculations, this quantity refers to the volume of the full supercell.

**Density:**
The calculated bulk crystalline density, in grams/cc.

**Material id:**
This number is used to uniquely identify a material in the database.

**Basal plane:** (?)
Plane perpendicular to the principal axis in monoclinic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and trigonal/hexagonal systems.

**Layered material:**
Structure made up of individual stacked atomically thin sheets.

**Nanoporous:**
Structure with pores (usually 100nm or smaller).

**Space group:**
A description of the symmetry of a structure representing the group of all transformations that leave a structure unchanged. Transformations include translation, reflection, rotation, improper rotation, screw axis, glide plane. There are 230 three-dimensioanl space groups.

**Topology:**
Properties of space that remain unchanged under continuous deformations (stretching, twisting, bending).

**CIF format:**
(Crystallographic Information File) Human- and machine-readable text file format for crystallographic information.

## Chemistry
**Oxidation state:**
The degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of the element in the material.

**Coordination number:**
The number of atoms to which the element in the material is bound.

**Composition:**
All the elements making up a structure and their corresponding amounts. (?)

**Ordered only:**
Refers to whether the initial crystal data was obtained explicitly from experimental data (true) or required converting fractional occupancies into integer occupancies though an ordering algorithm (false).

**Tautomer:**
Isomers that differ by the migration of an atom or group of atoms and that are in equilibrium.

**Charge balanced:**
A system with a net charge of zero.

**Functional group**
Group of atoms giving rise to specific chemical characteristics.

**Isosteric**
With the same number of atoms and valence electrons and the same valence electron configuration.


## Energetics
**Formation energy:**
Computed formation energy at 0K, 0atm using a reference state of zero for the pure elements. This quantity is often a good approximation for formation *enthalpy* at ambient conditions.

**Energy above hull:**
The energy of decomposition of this material into the set of most stable materials at this chemical composition, in eV/atom. Stability is tested against all potential chemical combinations that result in the material's composition. For example, a $\ce{Co2O3}$ structure would be tested for decomposition against other $\ce{Co2O3}$ structures, against $\ce{Co}$ and $\ce{O2}$ mixtures, and against $\ce{CoO}$ and $\ce{O2}$ mixtures.

A positive E above hull indicates that this material is unstable with respect to decomposition. A zero E above hull indicates that this is the most stable material at its composition.

**Electron affinity:**
Energy change when an electron is added to an atom.

**Ionization energy:**
Minimum energy change when a valence electron is removed from an atom.

**Energy landscape:**
A plot of energy values for all conformations of a system.

**Metastable:**
Stable at small disturbances.

**Gibbs free energy:**
Maximum reversible work that can be extracted from a system at constant temperature and pressure. It is an indication of the spontaneity of a reaction.
