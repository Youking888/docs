The MP website exposes a lot of data and tools. Sometimes, people are surprised to learn about data and tools that have been available on the site for months, especially if they have logged in and used the site recently. One way to keep returning users informed, seen on many websites, is a news feed. Such a feed consists of short entries, each with a date and summary of the news. Often, there is a subtle and unobtrusive visual cue for returning users to review recent news before continuing to use the site. In other cases, the recent news is presented in focus for the user to review and dismiss. Apart from viewing a feed while visiting its website, the feed may also be formatted as per e.g. the RSS or Atom specifications to allow users to aggregate such news feeds from many websites of interest. Data entry \u00b6 To enter news feed items, one creates a Markdown file in the newsfeed/data directory with a name of the format YYYY-MM-DD-entry-title.md , where YYYY-MM-DD is a ISO 8601 -formatted date. The file itself will look something like --- title: My feed item title --- This is a great piece of news. More info [here](https://materialsproject.org/newstuff). This format is based on that used by the Jekyll static site framework -- a simple organization of news items into separate files. The first section of the file (delimited by --- lines) is meta-data, aka \"front matter\", and will be pre-processed for relevant key-value pairs. The remainder of the file will be converted to HTML. This may be implemented in one pass, for example using the Python markdown package with it's built-in \"meta-data\" extension. The title is the only required piece of metadata. If the feed entry requires a significant change, then an updated metadata field and value (in YYYY-MM-DD format) should be added -- do not change the filename. If a change to the entry is insignificant, like fixing a typo, then you don't need to create or update an updated field. Data display \u00b6 The news feed is displayed in two places: on the static (not-signed-in) home page, and on the signed-in default app view. Both views are in centered, responsive two-column layouts near the top of their respective pages. For a signed-in user, there is up to three months of unseen news. For the static home page, the news fills the two columns -- this depends on the summary-lengths of the news items, but does not exceed ten items (five per column). Finally, the signed-in user view is dismissable with a click. Each feed item on display shows a date, a title, and a summary. The date is gathered from the item's filename or from its updated metdata field if given. The summary is the rendered HTML of the item file's Markdown body. Feed items are presented in reverse chronological order. Data management \u00b6 The last time a user has seen the newsfeed is stored in the app_db 's newsfeed_views collection, one document per user. The query return_document = app_db . newsfeed_views . find_one_and_update ( { \"user\" : request . user . username }, { \"$set\" : { \"last_seen\" : datetime . utcnow ()}, upsert = True ) will update a user's document (inserting a document if one doesn't exist) with the current time as the last-seen time, and return the old user document (or None if no document existed). The application can then determine which feed items to render to the user based on the last \"last_seen\" value. This example uses the Django request object to get a user's immutable username . The expression request.user.is_authenticated may be evaluated first in this case to determine which view is to be rendered.","title":"Newsfeed"},{"location":"contrib/spec/newsfeed/#newsfeed","text":"Info This page is a design specification for a feature to be implemented and tested before release.

This page describes how to develop your own applications using the data and software of the Materials Project. Programming language \u00b6 Although you can use any programming language to develop applications, we recommend the Python programming language (version 3.0 or newer). Python is the language of the Materials Project codebases, is widely used and supported by the scientific community, and allows for rapid development. If you choose not to use Python, we suggest a language with good JSON parsing support (JSON is the data exchange format of the Materials Project). In addition, we suggest a language that can easily make requests to web servers and fetch responses as JSON. Programming environment \u00b6 If you are programming in Python, we suggest using a Python IDE such as PyCharm (commercial) or Eclipse+PyDev (free). However, some people prefer to use a UNIX-style text editor such as vi or emacs. Getting and analyzing data using pymatgen \u00b6 The Materials Project provides an open-source Python code, pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics), that can be used to: Access Materials Project data Convert data between several file formats Perform materials analyses Set up calculations The pymatgen documentation provides many examples on how to perform common tasks.

In addition, the reaction calculator reports known experimental enthalpies (at 298 K and 1 atm) where available. The reaction calculator's energies are generally a good estimate of room temperature formation enthalpies, although all calculations are performed at 0 K and 0 atm. More information regarding methods to perform the calculations and their accuracy can be found in the Calculations Manual. Using the Reaction Calculator \u00b6 To use the reaction calculator, the reactants input and products input fields must be completed. Other fields are optional. Multiple advanced arguments may be specified by comma-separating each argument. Specifying Reactants and Products \u00b6 Reactants and Products are specified via chemical formula in the free-form text fields. Chemical formulas must be \"+\"-separated. The coefficients of all compounds are automatically determined; there is no need for the user to balance the reaction. For each chemical formula, our database automatically selects the lowest energy compound at the specified composition (handling of gaseous and liquid elements is explained in the Calculations Manual). The crystal structure used for a particular reaction calculation may be examined by clicking the blue links in the reaction output. There are several ways of specifying the chemical formula (examples follow). In all cases, element names should have only the first letter capitalized. Reactants - enter in this field a '+'-separated list of chemical formulas for the desired reactants. Usage example: Li + O + P + Fe Usage example: Li2O + Fe2O3 + P2O5 + O Usage example: LiFePO4 Products - enter in this field a '+'-separated list of chemical formulas for the desired products (same format as 'Reactants') The reaction energy will always be normalized for the reaction shown in the output. Choosing a particular phase / crystal structure \u00b6 This feature will be supported in a future release of the reaction calculator. Reading the output \u00b6 The reaction calculator balances the reaction and displays the balanced reaction as the first line in the output. The next line gives the computed reaction energy. When a computational energy is available, the computed \u0394H of reaction indicates the overall reaction energy of the reaction as written in the first line of the output. The \u0394Hf for each compound in the reaction lists formation energies from the elements. Clicking the compound displays its crystal structure. When an experimental energy is available, the computed \u0394H of reaction indicates the overall reaction enthalpy of the reaction as written in the first line of the output. The \u0394Hf for each compound in the reaction lists formation enthalpies from the elements. Sub-headings indicate the source(s) of experimental information. When both computational and experimental data are available, a graphical chart displays the error for each compound in the calculation. Calculation Details / Estimating Errors \u00b6 The Calculations Manual provides details on our calculation methodology and provides information on the magnitude of errors that may be expected.

The economic viability of non-aqueous and aqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs and AqRFBs respectively) is highly dependent on electroactive materials, salt, and solvent choices. 1 (#references) The interactive RFB Dashboard can be used to select redox active materials for use in nonaqueous and aqueous RFBs by displaying individual materials along with regions of economic viability defined by the target battery price and minimum redox active species concentration. 2 (#references) In addition, the tool provides concentration targets for redox active materials achieving the target battery price. This tool can be used to analyze both experimentally demonstrated materials and simulated families of materials. Reference 2 describes the techno-economic model implemented in the present tool. The default values of all input parameters are assumed to be the median values presented in Ref. 1. Redox Active Material Design Space \u00b6 Redox active materials are defined using three electrochemical properties: molecular weight (g/mol e-), redox potential (V vs. Li/Li+), and active material concentration (mol actives/kg solvent). The molecular weight is defined as the molecular weight of redox active material normalized by the number of electrons transferred. The redox potential is defined as the average potential of electron transfer events that the material undergoes. The molecular weight and redox potential of a redox active molecule can be measured or simulated in less time and with more accuracy than active material solubility. Thus, the RFB Dashboard shows redox active materials on a two-dimensional materials-selection map, with axes of molecular weight and redox potential, while drawing concentration contours that achieves the target battery price. In the model each material is assumed to pair with a hypothetical counter-electrode material having a different potential than the material of interest, but common concentration and molecular weight. Using the RFB Dashboard \u00b6 Importing Data for Analysis \u00b6 Via Molecule Explorer \u00b6 Data can be imported into the tool via Molecule Explorer. By clicking on the \"via Molecule Explorer\" button on top of the RFB Dashboard, the Molecule Explorer would appear and materials with desired structures can be selected. Once a set of molecules is selected, click on the \"Explore Solubility\" button to import them into the RFB Dashboard for further analysis. For a visual tutorial on how to import data via Molecule Explorer, a short video is available to demonstrate how the Molecule Explorer is used. Via CSV \u00b6 Data can be imported into the tool via a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. The CSV file should be formatted in such a way that there is a header for the first row of the data sheet and the order of the data columns does not matter. However, the header names for each column has to have 'formula' for molecular formula, 'mw' for molecular weight, 'redpot' for reduction potential and 'oxpot' for oxidation potential. Once your CSV file is ready, it can be uploaded into the tool by clicking on the \"via CSV\" button on top of the tool to upload the file, and the data will then be displayed on the tool. Description of Input Parameters \u00b6 Target Battery Price \u00b6 The Target Battery Price is the maximum battery price for RFBs built using the redox active materials enclosed by the concentration contours. The battery price is a combination of reactor cost, electrolyte cost, balance-of-plant and addition-to-price costs. Battery price neglects the cost of power-conditioning equipment that is included in system price defined in Ref. 1. As a result, when calculating battery price balance-of-plant costs are reduced by $100/kW compared to that in Ref. 1 used to calculate system price. ($/kWh) Target Molality \u00b6 The Target Molality is the minimum concentration achieving the target battery price for redox active materials enclosed by the concentration contours. The molality is defined as a ratio of moles of redox active species to kilograms of solvent in mol/kg. Cost Parameters \u00b6 Reactor Cost Per Unit Area ($/m2) Salt Cost: cost per unit mass of supporting salt ($/kg) Solvent Cost: cost per unit mass of solvent ($/kg) Active Material Cost: cost per unit mass of active material ($/kg) Additional Contribution to Price: accounts for depreciation, labor, overhead, and margin ($/kW) Balance of Plant Cost: accounts for ancillary equipment costs ($/kW) Operating Conditions \u00b6 System Discharge Time: battery discharge time (hours) Depth of Discharge: allowable range of state-of-charge (-) Discharge Voltage Efficiency: ratio of cell potential during cycling to the thermodynamically reversible open-circuit cell potential (-) Round-trip Coulombic Efficiency: ratio of the charge released during the discharging step of a complete cycle relative to the charge stored during the charging step of a complete cycle. (-) Discharge System Efficiency: accounts for losses in energy during discharge due to auxiliary equipment. (-) Electrochemical Parameters \u00b6 Area-Specific Resistance: accounts for ohmic, kinetic, and mass-transfer resistance in the separator, electrodes, and electrolyte (\u03a9-cm2) Stability Limits (Nonaqueous only): solvent window of stability beyond which breakdown occurs (V vs. Li/Li+) Hypothetical Counter-Electrode Potential (Nonaqueous only): assumed hypothetical counter-electrode for full-cell analysis of single electrode materials. (V vs. Li/Li+) pH (Aqueous only): sets the pH of the aqueous solution. Aqueous stability limits are determined by the oxygen and hydrogen evolution potentials, which depend on the pH of the solution. The hypothetical counter-electrode potentials are selected in order to be within the stability limits within a margin of the \"Voltage Offset\" parameter. (-) Voltage Offset (Aqueous only): Hypothetical counter-electrodes, with which each molecule of interest is paired, are specified by an increment in voltage, called the Voltage Offset. For positive-electrode molecules of interest the potential of the counter-electrode exceeds the hydrogen evolution potential by the magnitude of the Voltage Offset, and for negative-electrode molecules of interest the potential of the counter-electrode is set below the oxygen evolution potential by the magnitude of the Voltage Offset.

The molecular weight is defined as the molecular weight of redox active material normalized by the number of electrons transferred. The redox potential is defined as the average potential of electron transfer events that the material undergoes. The molecular weight and redox potential of a redox active molecule can be measured or simulated in less time and with more accuracy than active material solubility. Thus, the RFB Dashboard shows redox active materials on a two-dimensional materials-selection map, with axes of molecular weight and redox potential, while drawing concentration contours that achieves the target battery price.
